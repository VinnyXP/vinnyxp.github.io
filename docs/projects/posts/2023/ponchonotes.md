# Poncho Notes
*Where Ideas Stick and Sustain*

PonchoNotes revolutionizes note-taking by introducing an augmented reality experience. Unlike traditional sticky notes confined by physical space, our application transcends these limitations. Paper-based notes often lead to environmental waste and pose long-term sustainability challenges. 

Our solution transforms note-taking into augmented reality, providing users with limitless space, knowledge graph organization, and a sustainable alternative to traditional methods.

## What it does
In simple terms, PonchoNotes is a note companion built for augmented reality systems that are able to interop with your smartphone and other devices without stealing your attention.

## Development Process
A good majority of our work was maintaining parity in terms of the team's overall understanding which allowed us to flex into building different milestones of the minimum viable product. Iteration was a key aspect of what we would consider a success in a hackathon. Our tech stack included Unity, C#, and the XREAL SDK.

## What I Learned
The PonchoNotes project served as a transformative learning experience for the team. Most of us began this journey with limited to no familiarity with Unity and augmented reality tools. The learning curve encompassed everything from grasping the intricacies of raytracing to understanding the hardware nuances behind AR glasses. Our collective immersion into these realms expanded our skill set and deepened our understanding of the immersive technologies driving PonchoNotes.

## Improvement Room
Moving forward, our focus for PonchoNotes is on refining the project's user interface (UI) to enhance its realism and overall user experience. Our goal is to make the project look and feel more authentic, providing users with an immersive and visually appealing digital environment for note-taking. 

This effort goes beyond aesthetics; it's about creating a UI that seamlessly mirrors the physical world, elevating the application to be an intuitive extension of the user's cognitive space. By fine-tuning UI elements, we aim to optimize usability, positioning PonchoNotes as a leading player in the augmented reality note-taking space.
